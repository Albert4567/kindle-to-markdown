# kindle-to-markdown

This project is made for those who want their Kindle highlights on their preferred editor. You can create markdown files starting from 
***MyClippings.txt***. The markdown files'll contain your highlights and notes.

To run it you should:
1. clone the project or at least the already built .jar
2. put the .jar in a directory you create
3. put ***MyClippings.txt*** in the .jar directory
4. open the CLI and run the .jar

The program generates:
- a directory called ***booksHighlights*** containing your highlights. One markdown file foreach book you read
- a log file which contains the operations performed by the application
